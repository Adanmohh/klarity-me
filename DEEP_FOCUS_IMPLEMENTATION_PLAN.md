# Deep Focus TODO System - Implementation Plan

## Core Concept
**"One card at a time, progress over completion, momentum over intensity"**

A focus-lock system where users work on one active card at a time, with long-running projects that span days/weeks. Sessions end without completing cards, and cards maintain momentum across multiple work sessions.

## Phase 1: Core Focus Lock System
**Priority: CRITICAL - This is the foundation**

### 1. Refactor Card Detail View as Focus Session
- [ ] Move timer, pomodoro, and break system INTO CardDetailView
- [ ] Add session state: `active` | `paused` | `ended`
- [ ] Lock navigation when session active (disable nav buttons/show warning)
- [ ] Add "End Session" and "Pause" buttons prominently

### 2. Card States & Queue System
- [ ] Add card states: `active`, `queued`, `on-hold`, `completed`
- [ ] Only ONE card can be `active` at a time
- [ ] Implement queue order (position field)
- [ ] Auto-advance: When card completed ‚Üí next queued becomes active

### 3. Session Completion vs Card Completion
- [ ] Add "End Session" (different from complete card)
- [ ] Session end returns card to queue
- [ ] Track `last_worked_on` timestamp
- [ ] Add `sessions_count` to track work sessions

## Phase 2: Card Management & Organization

### 4. Drag-and-Drop Queue Manager
- [ ] New view: `/focus` shows card organizer when no active session
- [ ] Draggable card list to reorder queue
- [ ] Visual indicators: position numbers, "next up" badge
- [ ] Can only reorder when no active session

### 5. Kanban Board View
- [ ] Alternative view toggle: List | Kanban
- [ ] Columns: Active | Queued | On Hold | Completed
- [ ] Drag between columns (except Active - that's locked)
- [ ] Quick actions: Archive, Delete from kanban

### 6. Pause System
- [ ] Micro-pause: 5 min break, stay in card context
- [ ] Session pause: Unlocks navigation, saves state
- [ ] Card pause: "Hide for X days" (moves to on-hold)
- [ ] Resume exactly where left off

## Phase 3: Progress & Momentum

### 7. Card Momentum Indicators
- [ ] Hot streak: Worked 3+ consecutive days üî•
- [ ] Cooling: 2-3 days since last work ‚ö†Ô∏è
- [ ] Cold: 5+ days dormant ‚ùÑÔ∏è
- [ ] Visual badges on cards

### 8. Context Preservation
- [ ] "Where I left off" note field (shown on resume)
- [ ] Card journal: Auto-log each session
- [ ] Session summary: Tasks completed, time spent
- [ ] Persistent "Next action" at top of card

### 9. Progress Tracking
- [ ] Milestone system: Set 3-5 major goals per card
- [ ] Progress bar based on task completion
- [ ] Weekly progress graph per card
- [ ] Session history log

## Phase 4: Enhanced Task Management

### 10. Task Aging
- [ ] Visual fade for tasks older than 7 days
- [ ] "Stale" lane for old untouched tasks
- [ ] Periodic prompt: "Review stale tasks?"
- [ ] Bulk actions: refresh, archive, delete stale

### 11. Breakthrough Tasks
- [ ] Mark 1-2 tasks as "breakthrough" ‚≠ê
- [ ] Highlight these specially
- [ ] Track when completed (unlocks momentum)
- [ ] Optional: completing breakthrough auto-ends session

### 12. Controller Card (Inbox)
- [ ] Special persistent card: "Inbox" or "Triage"
- [ ] All new tasks land here first
- [ ] Daily ritual: Process inbox ‚Üí assign to cards
- [ ] Can work on inbox without it being "active"

## Phase 5: Smart Features

### 13. Focus Protection
- [ ] "Deep Mode": Can't pause for first 25 min
- [ ] "Do Not Disturb": No task edits during session
- [ ] Navigation lock with confirmation dialog
- [ ] Session commitment timer

### 14. Forced Breaks
- [ ] 5-10 min transition between cards
- [ ] Show completion summary
- [ ] Gentle prompt to move/stretch
- [ ] Preview next card before starting

### 15. Smart Queue Ordering
- [ ] Due dates for cards (soft deadlines)
- [ ] Auto-sort options: deadline, momentum, manual
- [ ] "Suggested next" based on patterns
- [ ] Warning for approaching deadlines

## Phase 6: Review & Analytics

### 16. Weekly Review System
- [ ] Sunday prompt for card review
- [ ] Progress summary per card
- [ ] Archive completed cards
- [ ] Reorder queue for next week
- [ ] Momentum report

### 17. Deep Dive Mode
- [ ] Declare focus week on single card
- [ ] Special UI theme
- [ ] Other cards auto-pause
- [ ] Daily default to deep dive card

### 18. Collaboration Markers
- [ ] "Blocked by" indicator
- [ ] "Waiting on" state (different from pause)
- [ ] "Ready for review" flag
- [ ] Visual badges for blockers

## Technical Implementation Order

**Week 1:** Phase 1 (Core Focus Lock)
- This is the fundamental change
- Everything else builds on this

**Week 2:** Phase 2 (Card Management)
- Drag-drop and kanban views
- Pause system

**Week 3:** Phase 3 (Progress & Momentum)
- Context preservation

**Week 4:** Phase 4 (Task Management)
- Task aging, breakthrough tasks
- Controller card

**Week 5-6:** Phase 5 & 6 (Smart Features & Analytics)
- Protection features
- Review systems
- Deep dive mode

## Database Changes Needed

### Cards Table
- Add `state` enum: active, queued, on-hold, completed
- Add `position` integer for queue order
- Add `last_worked_on` timestamp
- Add `momentum_score` integer
- Add `sessions_count` integer
- Add `where_left_off` text field

### New Tables

**Sessions Table**
- id
- card_id
- started_at
- ended_at
- duration_minutes
- tasks_completed
- notes

**Milestones Table**
- id
- card_id
- title
- description
- completed
- completed_at
- position

**CardJournal Table**
- id
- card_id
- session_id
- entry_type (session_start, session_end, note, breakthrough)
- content
- created_at

### Tasks Table Updates
- Add `created_at` timestamp
- Add `is_breakthrough` boolean
- Add `is_stale` boolean
- Add `last_touched` timestamp

## Key User Flows

### Starting Work
1. Open app ‚Üí Focus view
2. If no active card ‚Üí See queue ‚Üí Pick card
3. Card becomes active ‚Üí Enter focus session
4. Timer starts ‚Üí Navigation locked
5. Work on tasks (Controller ‚Üí Main)

### Ending Session
1. Click "End Session" (not complete)
2. Prompt: "Where did you leave off?"
3. Session summary shown
4. Card returns to queue
5. Navigation unlocked

### Pausing
1. Micro-pause: Quick 5 min, stay in context
2. Session pause: Save state, unlock navigation
3. Card pause: Move to on-hold for X days

### Card Completion
1. Mark card as complete
2. Celebration animation
3. Auto-advance to next queued card
4. Or end session if no cards queued

## Success Metrics
- Average session duration
- Cards touched per week (momentum)
- Task completion rate
- Streak days per card
- Time from card creation to completion
