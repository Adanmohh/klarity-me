- Improved error messages with specific status codes
- Added proper error recovery mechanisms

### 3. UI/UX Design Improvements ✅
**Problems:** 
- Inconsistent glassmorphism implementation
- Poor visual hierarchy
- Missing accessibility features
- Basic styling not matching app theme

**Solutions Implemented:**

#### Visual Design Enhancements:
- Applied glassmorphism effects to all cards using `GlassCard` component
- Enhanced tab navigation with motion animations and proper hover states
- Improved textarea styling with backdrop blur and focus states

### Remaining Recommendations (Future Improvements):

#### Quick Wins (Low Effort, High Impact):
1. Add loading skeleton screens instead of spinner
2. Implement toast notifications for success states
3. Add character count limit indicator (e.g., "150/1000 characters")
4. Include keyboard shortcuts display in UI

#### Strategic Improvements (Higher Effort):
1. Add auto-save functionality for journal entries
2. Implement journal entry history/drafts
3. Add voice-to-text input option
4. Include mood tracking visualization
5. Add export functionality for extracted tasks

#### Polish Items:
1. Add subtle micro-animations for task cards
2. Implement dark mode support
